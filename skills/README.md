# iii Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for building with the
[iii engine](https://github.com/iii-hq/iii) — functions, triggers, workers, state, streams, and
more.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Amp, Goose, Roo Code, GitHub Copilot, VS Code,
OpenAI Codex, and [30+ other agents](https://agentskills.io).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add iii-hq/iii/skills
```

### Install a single skill

```bash
npx skills add iii-hq/iii/skills --skill iii-http-endpoints
```

### Git clone

```bash
# Claude Code
git clone https://github.com/iii-hq/iii.git /tmp/iii && cp -r /tmp/iii/skills/iii-* ~/.claude/skills/

# Cursor
git clone https://github.com/iii-hq/iii.git /tmp/iii && cp -r /tmp/iii/skills/iii-* ~/.cursor/skills/

# Gemini CLI
git clone https://github.com/iii-hq/iii.git /tmp/iii && cp -r /tmp/iii/skills/iii-* ~/.gemini/skills/
```

### Multi-agent sync

If you use multiple agents, SkillKit keeps skills in sync across all of them:

```bash
npx skills add iii-hq/iii/skills
npx skillkit sync --agent claude-code
npx skillkit sync --agent cursor
npx skillkit sync --agent gemini-cli
```

Supports 32+ agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Amp, Goose, Roo
Code, GitHub Copilot, and more.

## Format

Each skill follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

```text
skills/
├── iii-http-endpoints/
│   └── SKILL.md                # YAML frontmatter (name + description) + markdown instructions
├── iii-channels/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── http-endpoints.js       # TypeScript reference implementation
│   ├── http-endpoints.py       # Python reference implementation
│   ├── http-endpoints.rs       # Rust reference implementation
│   ├── iii-config.yaml         # Shared engine config reference
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Skills are activated automatically when the agent detects a matching task based on the description
field. Code references live in the `references/` directory, named after their skill.
